igraph 0.7.1 and libxml2-dev are required to be installed on the
machine to compile and run the main.
gengetopt is also required to compile the program.
In order to compile:
   open the terminal in the directory of the euler_pat.* and main.c
   and run make.

--help or -h are the options to get more infos about what options can
  be passed. It is supposed that at least are passed -f <file name> to
  specify what input file has to be read and -t <file type> to specify
  the format the file is written. Moreover can be specified a name of
  a file where to save the output of the program with -o <file output
  name> if the output file doesn't exist it will be created, if it
  exists it will be overwritten. If -o option isn't specified the
  output will be printed on the console.
  An example of how the program must be execute is:
     ./main.exe -f test.exe -t e -o output.txt

The output of the file is the sequence of nodes which has to be
visited in oreder to create an eulerian path or cycle.

The return values are:
    0 if everythng goes right, the path exists and is written on the
      file or on the output stream(the console usually)
    1 if the graph isn't eulerian or semi-eulerian
    2 if the input file doesn't exist
    3 if the file type passed with option -t isn't valid
    4 if there are problems in opening the output file in order to
      write on it
